`MHWI_AmmoCrafter` is an automatic  ammunition crafting tool for Monster Hunter World.

## Features
- **Description**: Crafts up to three different ammo types automatically based on a set of conditions.
- **Craft Conditions**: Users select a specific ammo type and set a thresholds limit as the main crafting condition.
- **Trigger Mechanisms**: Auto-crafting is triggered when the craft conditions are met and after the pressing of the firing button. If holding the firing button, the script will continually run the auto-crafting check at a specified frequency.
- **Compatible Controls**: Supports both PS4 Controller and Keyboard & Mouse setups.

## Usage
To use `MHWI_AmmoCrafter`, define the craft item menu locations and then configure the auto-craft condition by setting a desired ammo type's threshold limit. The tool checks for these conditions and crafts ammo accordingly during gameplay.
